# Meloetic
Meloetic is a project that aims to investigate the hidden melodies that exist under every piece of text. 

### Background
The idea behind the project is that songs exist as abstractions and are waiting to be discovered, not created. Meloetic represents a single approach to automate songwriting mathematically. The program assigns a melody to a given piece of text by interpreting the length of each token as its degree on a scale. This mapping is clearly not unique.

The particular usage of this program that inspired its creation is the ability to compare songs' written melodies with their melodies as dictated by this mapping. Other notable use cases include the melodic interpretation of well-known textual sources (e.g. celebrity quotes or political soundbites) and the soundtracking of text messages.
